ClusView follows the following guidelines regarding issues, PRs and commit history.

## Issues
Issues are the main point of information about proposals, bugs and any other type of discussion.

Explain the problem in detail and the proposed solution. No need to be explicit about code,
outlining the high-level view of the changes is sufficient.

Issues are always labeled in two categories:
- `type : [bug, doc, enhancement]`: nature of the problem and changes.
- `state : [pending, discarded, duplicate, accepted]`: state of the issue.

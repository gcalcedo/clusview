    Davies-Bouldin score metric.

    The Davies-Bouldin score is a measure of the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster,
    taking into account both the scatter within each cluster and the separation between clusters.
    It is defined as the average of the ratio of the within-cluster scatter to the between-cluster separation.

    The score is lower when clusters are well-separated and have low intra-cluster variance,
    indicating better clustering performance.

    Implementation based on scikit-learn:

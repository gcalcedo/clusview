description: Overview of Clusview packages.

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Clusview is organized in different packages under the **`packages`** directory,
located at the root of the [project](https://github.com/gcalcedo/clusview).
Here's a quick overview of the **`packages`** directory structure, with the core
package highlighted:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
  - packages/
    - **core/** # Standalone package, the Clusview logic.
    - docs/ # Documentation, this very site!
    - ui/ # UI to interact with the core package.
    - benchmark/ # Experiment & benchmark suite.
</FileTree>

All packages are maintained in the same repository to ease local development,
since they are heavily related or directly dependant on **`core`**.

## A peaceful morning
Picture yourself as a curator in a museum.

One peaceful morning, your museum receives a large crate of archives from Ancient Greece.

![ancient_greece](../../../assets/images/ancient_greece.jpg)

You are tasked with organizing and displaying these archives in a way that is both informative and coherent to visitors.

How would you go about this? Ordering by style? By time period? By subject matter? And to make things more
complicated, how many groups should you divide the archives into? Suddenly, the morning is not so peaceful anymore.

As you might have noticed, there is no right answer for this. And even if you find the optimal way to do this,
would that approach work for another crate with a completely different set of archives? Probably not.

### Topic Modeling

This is where the concept of [Topic Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) comes in to restore the peacefulness of your morning.

Suppose you could feed the archives into a machine, and it would automatically group them into coherent topics.
Well, recent techniques in Natural Language Processing,
such as [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) have made this possible,
leveraging the power of [transformers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)) This sound amazing!

Not so fast! There is, however, no silver bullet for how to use these tools, my dear curator.
No oracle can tell you the best way to group your archives. Natural language is fuzzy, and what constitutes a good topic
for you might not be the same for someone else.

### Clusview

And so, we arrive at [Clusview](/). A tool designed to ease the process of exploring and understanding the topics
with an interactive approach. So you can decide what is the best way to group your archives.

Keep reading, your journey with Clusview starts here!

## Installation
Currently, Clusview has no hosted solution. The easiest way to use Clusview is to run it locally on your machine.

<Steps>

1. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone/) the Clusview repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/gcalcedo/clusview).

    <Code code={"git clone https://github.com/gcalcedo/clusview.git"} lang="shell" />

2. Navigate to the core Clusview package.

    <Code code={"cd clusview/packages/clusview"} lang="shell" />

    Clusview is organized in different packages under the **`packages`** directory.
    The core package (**`packages/clusview`**), implemented in Python, is where the main functionality is.
    This is also a standalone module, so you can use it in your own projects without the use of the UI.

    Here's a quick overview of the packages structure:

    <FileTree>
    - ...
    - packages/
        - **clusview/** # This is the core package.
        - docs/ # Documentation, this very site!
        - ui/ # UI to interact with the core package.
    - ...
    </FileTree>

3. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

    <Code code={"python -m venv venv"} lang="shell" />

    The only pre-requisite you need to use Clusview is a Python installation.

    <Aside type="caution" title="Python Version Compatibility">
        Clusview has been developed with **`Python 3.12.3`**.
        Older versions may work as well, but this is not yet tested. 
    </Aside>

4. Install dependencies in **`requirements.txt`** via **`pip`**.

    <Code code={"pip install -r requirements.txt"} lang="shell" />

5. Done!

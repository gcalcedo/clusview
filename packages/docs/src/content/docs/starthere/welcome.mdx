Picture yourself as a curator in a museum.

One peaceful morning, your museum receives a large crate of archives from
Ancient Greece.

![ancient_greece](../../../assets/images/ancient_greece.jpg)

You are tasked with organizing and displaying these archives in a way that is
both informative and coherent to visitors.

How would you go about this? Grouping by style? By time period? By subject
matter? And to make things more complicated, how many groups should you divide
the archives into? Suddenly, the morning is not so peaceful anymore.

As you might have noticed, there is no right answer for this. And even if you
find the optimal way to do this, would that approach work for another crate with
a completely different set of archives? Probably not.

### Topic Modeling

This is where the concept of
[Topic Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) comes in to restore
the peacefulness of your morning.

Suppose you could feed the archives into a machine, and it would automatically
group them into coherent topics. Well, recent techniques in Natural Language
Processing, such as [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html),
have made this possible leveraging the power of
[transformers.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)>)
Problem solved then, right?

Not so fast! There is, however, no silver bullet for how to use these tools, my
dear curator. No oracle can tell you the best way to group your archives.
Natural language is fuzzy, and what constitutes a good topic for you might not
be the same for someone else.

### Clusview

And so, we arrive at [Clusview](/clusview). A tool designed to ease the process
of exploring and understanding the topics with an interactive approach. So you
can decide what is the best way to group your archives.

## Installation

Currently, there is no hosted solution for Clusview. The easiest way to use
Clusview is to import it locally in your projects.

<Steps>

1.  [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone/) the Clusview repository from
    [GitHub](https://github.com/gcalcedo/clusview).

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/gcalcedo/clusview.git

    ```

2.  In your own project, install the **`core`** package from the path of the
    Clusview repository you just cloned.

    ```shell
    pip install path_to_clusview/packages/core/
    ```

3.  Done! Clusview components can now be imported into your Python scripts.

    ```python
    from clusview.samplers.parameters.linear_sampler import LinearSampler

    sampling = LinearSampler("x", 0, 10, 6).sample_range()
    print(sampling)
    ```

    ```python
    >>> [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

    <Aside type="caution" title="Python Version Compatibility">
      The **`core`** package has been developed with **`Python 3.12.3`**. Older versions may
      work as well, but this is not yet tested.
